For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n\t   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n\t   *\n\t   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n\t   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n\t   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n\t   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n\t   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n\t   *\n\t   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n\t   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n\t   *\n\t   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n\t   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t   *\n\t   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n\t   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n\t   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n\t   *\n\t   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n\t   *\n\t   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n\t   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n\t   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n\t   *\n\t   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n\t   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n\t   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n\t   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n\t   *\n\t   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n\t   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n\t   *     }\n\t   *\n\t   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t   *\n\t   */\n\t  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n\t    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n\t      return false;\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n\t        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n\t      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n\t      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n\t      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n\t        return true;\n\t      }\n\t      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n\t        return false;\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n\t        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n\t        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t    return false;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function fromJS(json, converter) {\n\t    return converter ?\n\t      fromJSWith(converter, json, '', {'': json}) :\n\t      fromJSDefault(json);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function fromJSWith(converter, json, key, parentJSON) {\n\t    if (Array.isArray(json)) {\n\t      return converter.call(parentJSON, key, IndexedSeq(json).map(function(v, k)  {return fromJSWith(converter, v, k, json)}));\n\t    }\n\t    if (isPlainObj(json)) {\n\t      return converter.call(parentJSON, key, KeyedSeq(json).map(function(v, k)  {return fromJSWith(converter, v, k, json)}));\n\t    }\n\t    return json;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function fromJSDefault(json) {\n\t    if (Array.isArray(json)) {\n\t      return IndexedSeq(json).map(fromJSDefault).toList();\n\t    }\n\t    if (isPlainObj(json)) {\n\t      return KeyedSeq(json).map(fromJSDefault).toMap();\n\t    }\n\t    return json;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function isPlainObj(value) {\n\t    return value && (value.constructor === Object || value.constructor === undefined);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  var src_Math__imul =\n\t    typeof Math.imul === 'function' && Math.imul(0xffffffff, 2) === -2 ?\n\t    Math.imul :\n\t    function imul(a, b) {\n\t      a = a | 0; // int\n\t      b = b | 0; // int\n\t      var c = a & 0xffff;\n\t      var d = b & 0xffff;\n\t      // Shift by 0 fixes the sign on the high part.\n\t      return (c * d) + ((((a >>> 16) * d + c * (b >>> 16)) << 16) >>> 0) | 0; // int\n\t    };\n\t\n\t  // v8 has an optimization for storing 31-bit signed numbers.\n\t  // Values which have either 00 or 11 as the high order bits qualify.\n\t  // This function drops the highest order bit in a signed number, maintaining\n\t  // the sign bit.\n\t  function smi(i32) {\n\t    return ((i32 >>> 1) & 0x40000000) | (i32 & 0xBFFFFFFF);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function hash(o) {\n\t    if (o === false || o === null || o === undefined) {\n\t      return 0;\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof o.valueOf === 'function') {\n\t      o = o.valueOf();\n\t      if (o === false || o === null || o === undefined) {\n\t        return 0;\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t    if (o === true) {\n\t      return 1;\n\t    }\n\t    var type = typeof o;\n\t    if (type === 'number') {\n\t      var h = o | 0;\n\t      if (h !== o) {\n\t        h ^= o * 0xFFFFFFFF;\n\t      }\n\t      while (o > 0xFFFFFFFF) {\n\t        o /= 0xFFFFFFFF;\n\t        h ^= o;\n\t      }\n\t      return smi(h);\n\t    }\n\t    if (type === 'string') {\n\t      return o.length > STRING_HASH_CACHE_MIN_STRLEN ? cachedHashString(o) : hashString(o);\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof o.hashCode === 'function') {\n\t      return o.hashCode();\n\t    }\n\t    return hashJSObj(o);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function cachedHashString(string) {\n\t    var hash = stringHashCache[string];\n\t    if (hash === undefined) {\n\t      hash = hashString(string);\n\t      if (STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE === STRING_HASH_CACHE_MAX_SIZE) {\n\t        STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE = 0;\n\t        stringHashCache = {};\n\t      }\n\t      STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE++;\n\t      stringHashCache[string] = hash;\n\t    }\n\t    return hash;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  // http://jsperf.com/hashing-strings\n\t  function hashString(string) {\n\t    // This is the hash from JVM\n\t    // The hash code for a string is computed as\n\t    // s[0] * 31 ^ (n - 1) + s[1] * 31 ^ (n - 2) + ... + s[n - 1],\n\t    // where s[i] is the ith character of the string and n is the length of\n\t    // the string.

Rolls against Endurance determine things like whether your character can hang on to that rope over a canyon, or can resist the deadly cloud of bacteria some renegade scientist just sprayed in his or her face.\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"energyWeapons\": \"Energy Weapons\",\n\t\t\t\t\"experience\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"XP\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Experience\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"experienceMultiplier\": \"Experience Multiplier\",\n\t\t\t\t\"explorer\": \"Explorer\",\n\t\t\t\t\"explosiveDamage\": \"Explosive Damage\",\n\t\t\t\t\"explosives\": \"Explosives\",\n\t\t\t\t\"eyes\": \"Eyes\",\n\t\t\t\t\"fallDamage\": \"Fall Damage\",\n\t\t\t\t\"fastMetabolism\": \"Fast Metabolism\",\n\t\t\t\t\"fastShot\": \"Fast Shot\",\n\t\t\t\t\"fasterHealing\": \"Faster Healing\",\n\t\t\t\t\"fearTheReaper\": \"Fear The Reaper\",\n\t\t\t\t\"feralDog\": \"Feral Dog\",\n\t\t\t\t\"feralGhoul\": \"Feral Ghoul\",\n\t\t\t\t\"feralGhoulReaver\": \"Feral Ghoul Reaver\",\n\t\t\t\t\"feralGhoulRoamer\": \"Feral Ghoul Roamer\",\n\t\t\t\t\"feralGlowingOne\": \"Feral Glowing One\",\n\t\t\t\t\"finesse\": \"Finesse\",\n\t\t\t\t\"fireAnt\": \"Fire Ant\",\n\t\t\t\t\"fireBreath\": \"Fire Breath\",\n\t\t\t\t\"fireGecko\": \"Fire Gecko\",\n\t\t\t\t\"firstAid\": \"First Aid\",\n\t\t\t\t\"firstAidActionPointCost\": \"First Aid Action Point Cost\",\n\t\t\t\t\"firstAidHealing\": \"First Aid Healing\",\n\t\t\t\t\"flail\": \"Flail\",\n\t\t\t\t\"flailer\": \"Flailer\",\n\t\t\t\t\"flexible\": \"Flexible\",\n\t\t\t\t\"floater\": \"Floater\",\n\t\t\t\t\"flowerChild\": \"Flower Child\",\n\t\t\t\t\"forehead\": \"Forehead\",\n\t\t\t\t\"fortuneFinder\": \"Fortune Finder\",\n\t\t\t\t\"freeMovement\": \"Free Movement\",\n\t\t\t\t\"gainAgility\": \"Gain Agility\",\n\t\t\t\t\"gainCharisma\": \"Gain Charisma\",\n\t\t\t\t\"gainEndurance\": \"Gain Endurance\",\n\t\t\t\t\"gainIntelligence\": \"Gain Intelligence\",\n\t\t\t\t\"gainLuck\": \"Gain Luck\",\n\t\t\t\t\"gainPerception\": \"Gain Perception\",\n\t\t\t\t\"gainStrength\": \"Gain Strength\",\n\t\t\t\t\"gambler\": \"Gambler\",\n\t\t\t\t\"gambling\": \"Gambling\",\n\t\t\t\t\"gecko\": \"Gecko\",\n\t\t\t\t\"ghost\": \"Ghost\",\n\t\t\t\t\"ghoul\": \"Ghoul\",\n\t\t\t\t\"giantAnt\": \"Giant Ant\",\n\t\t\t\t\"giantRat\": \"Giant Rat\",\n\t\t\t\t\"gifted\": \"Gifted\",\n\t\t\t\t\"glowingOne\": \"Glowing One\",\n\t\t\t\t\"goldenGecko\": \"Golden Gecko\",\n\t\t\t\t\"goodNatured\": \"Good Natured\",\n\t\t\t\t\"greaterMolerat\": \"Greater Molerat\",\n\t\t\t\t\"greaterRadscorpion\": \"Greater Radscorption\",\n\t\t\t\t\"groin\": \"Groin\",\n\t\t\t\t\"gunner\": \"Gunner\",\n\t\t\t\t\"gut\": \"Gut\",\n\t\t\t\t\"hair\": \"Hair\",\n\t\t\t\t\"hamFisted\": \"Ham-Fisted\",\n\t\t\t\t\"hand\": \"Hand\",\n\t\t\t\t\"handToHandEvade\": \"Hand-to-Hand Evade\",\n\t\t\t\t\"harmless\": \"Harmless\",\n\t\t\t\t\"head\": \"Head\",\n\t\t\t\t\"healer\": \"Healer\",\n\t\t\t\t\"healingRate\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"HR\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Healing Rate\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"health\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"HP\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Health\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"heaveHo\": \"Heave, Ho!\",\n\t\t\t\t\"height\": \"Height\",\n\t\t\t\t\"hereAndNow\": \"Here and Now\",\n\t\t\t\t\"hideOfScars\": \"Hide of Scars\",\n\t\t\t\t\"hip\": \"Hip\",\n\t\t\t\t\"hitTheDeck\": \"Hit the Deck\",\n\t\t\t\t\"horn\": \"Horn\",\n\t\t\t\t\"human\": \"Human\",\n\t\t\t\t\"input\": \"input\",\n\t\t\t\t\"intelligence\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"Int\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Intelligence\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"description\": \"Intelligence is a character's higher reasoning power.

Perceptive characters tend to be able to read another person's reactions, and can even tell when another person is lying. They can also make long-distance shots in combat that no one else can make. Highly perceptive characters are private investigators or snipers. Characters with low Perception walk about in their own little world. This statistic is used in the Sequence secondary statistic, and in several skills such as Lockpick, Traps, First Aid, and Doctor. The primary use of this statistic is to determine the maximum distance your character can shoot a ranged weapon effectively. The better the score, the farther you can accurately shoot. A high Perception is imperative for a sniper. Rolls against Perception are used when there is a little detail the character has a chance of noticing, such as the glisten off the scope of the sniper taking an aim at his or her head.\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"perks\": \"Perks\",\n\t\t\t\t\"pickpocket\": \"Pickpocket\",\n\t\t\t\t\"pilot\": \"Pilot\",\n\t\t\t\t\"presence\": \"Presence\",\n\t\t\t\t\"primaryTotal\": \"Primary Total\",\n\t\t\t\t\"psychoAddictionChance\": \"Psycho Addiction Chance\",\n\t\t\t\t\"psychoEffects\": \"Psycho Effects\",\n\t\t\t\t\"psychotic\": \"Psychotic\",\n\t\t\t\t\"pyromaniac\": \"Pyromaniac\",\n\t\t\t\t\"quickPockets\": \"Quick Pockets\",\n\t\t\t\t\"quickRecovery\": \"Quick Recovery\",\n\t\t\t\t\"race\": \"Race\",\n\t\t\t\t\"radChild\": \"Rad Child\",\n\t\t\t\t\"radRat\": \"Rad Rat\",\n\t\t\t\t\"radResistance\": \"Rad Resistance\",\n\t\t\t\t\"radiationBurst\": \"Radiation Burst\",\n\t\t\t\t\"radroach\": \"Radroach\",\n\t\t\t\t\"radsPerHour\": \"Rads per Hour\",\n\t\t\t\t\"ram\": \"Ram\",\n\t\t\t\t\"rangedActionPointCost\": \"Ranged Action Point Cost\",\n\t\t\t\t\"rangedDamage\": \"Ranged Damage\",\n\t\t\t\t\"rangedWeapons\": \"Ranged Weapons\",\n\t\t\t\t\"ranger\": \"Ranger\",\n\t\t\t\t\"receivedExplosiveDamage\": \"Received Explosion Damage\",\n\t\t\t\t\"redBaron\": \"Red Baron\",\n\t\t\t\t\"repair\": \"Repair\",\n\t\t\t\t\"repairHealing\": \"Repair Healing\",\n\t\t\t\t\"resistContactGas\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"CGR\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Contact Gas Resistance\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"resistElectricity\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"ER\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Electricity Resistance\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"resistExplosion\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"ExR\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Explosion Resistance\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"resistExplosionThreshold\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"ExT\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Explosion Threshold\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"resistFire\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"FR\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Fire Resistance\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"resistFireThreshold\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"FT\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Fire Threshold\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"resistInhaledGas\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"IGR\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Inhaled Gas Resistance\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"resistLaser\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"LR\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Laser Resistance\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"resistLaserThreshold\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"LT\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Laser Threshold\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"resistNormal\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"NR\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Normal Resistance\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"resistNormalThreshold\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"NT\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Normal Threshold\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"resistPlasma\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"PlR\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Plasma Resistance\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"resistPlasmaThreshold\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"PlT\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Plasma Threshold\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"resistPoison\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"PR\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Poison Resistance\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"resistRadiation\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"RR\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Radiation Resistance\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"rightArm\": \"Right Arm\",\n\t\t\t\t\"rightLeg\": \"Right Leg\",\n\t\t\t\t\"roadWarrior\": \"Road Warrior\",\n\t\t\t\t\"salesman\": \"Salesman\",\n\t\t\t\t\"science\": \"Science\",\n\t\t\t\t\"scout\": \"Scout\",\n\t\t\t\t\"screech\": \"Screech\",\n\t\t\t\t\"scrounger\": \"Scrounger\",\n\t\t\t\t\"sequence\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"Seq\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Sequence\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"sex\": \"Sex\",\n\t\t\t\t\"sexAppeal\": \"Sex Appeal\",\n\t\t\t\t\"sharpshooter\": \"Sharpshooter\",\n\t\t\t\t\"shoulder\": \"Shoulder\",\n\t\t\t\t\"silentDeath\": \"Silent Death\",\n\t\t\t\t\"silentRunning\": \"Silent Running\",\n\t\t\t\t\"simpleWeapons\": \"Simple Weapons\",\n\t\t\t\t\"skillPoints\": \"Skill Points\",\n\t\t\t\t\"skillPointsPerBook\": \"Skill Points per Book\",\n\t\t\t\t\"skillPointsPerLevel\": \"Skill Points per Level\",\n\t\t\t\t\"skilled\": \"Skilled\",\n\t\t\t\t\"skills\": \"Skills\",\n\t\t\t\t\"slayer\": \"Slayer\",\n\t\t\t\t\"smallFrame\": \"Small Frame\",\n\t\t\t\t\"smallGuns\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"SG\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Small Guns\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"smoothTalker\": \"Smooth Talker\",\n\t\t\t\t\"snakeEater\": \"Snake-Eater\",\n\t\t\t\t\"sneak\": \"Sneak\",\n\t\t\t\t\"sniper\": \"Sniper\",\n\t\t\t\t\"social\": \"Social\",\n\t\t\t\t\"speaker\": \"Speaker\",\n\t\t\t\t\"speech\": \"Speech\",\n\t\t\t\t\"spit\": \"Spit\",\n\t\t\t\t\"stalk\": \"Stalk\",\n\t\t\t\t\"standUpActionPointCost\": \"Stand Up Action Point Cost\",\n\t\t\t\t\"stat\": \"Stat!\",\n\t\t\t\t\"steadyArm\": \"Steady Arm\",\n\t\t\t\t\"steal\": \"Steal\",\n\t\t\t\t\"stoneWall\": \"Stonewall\",\n\t\t\t\t\"strength\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"Str\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Strength\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"description\": \"A measure of your character's physical strength and muscle power.

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function fromJS(json, converter) {\n    return converter ?\n      fromJSWith(converter, json, '', {'': json}) :\n      fromJSDefault(json);\n  }\n\n  function fromJSWith(converter, json, key, parentJSON) {\n    if (Array.isArray(json)) {\n      return converter.call(parentJSON, key, IndexedSeq(json).map(function(v, k)  {return fromJSWith(converter, v, k, json)}));\n    }\n    if (isPlainObj(json)) {\n      return converter.call(parentJSON, key, KeyedSeq(json).map(function(v, k)  {return fromJSWith(converter, v, k, json)}));\n    }\n    return json;\n  }\n\n  function fromJSDefault(json) {\n    if (Array.isArray(json)) {\n      return IndexedSeq(json).map(fromJSDefault).toList();\n    }\n    if (isPlainObj(json)) {\n      return KeyedSeq(json).map(fromJSDefault).toMap();\n    }\n    return json;\n  }\n\n  function isPlainObj(value) {\n    return value && (value.constructor === Object || value.constructor === undefined);\n  }\n\n  var src_Math__imul =\n    typeof Math.imul === 'function' && Math.imul(0xffffffff, 2) === -2 ?\n    Math.imul :\n    function imul(a, b) {\n      a = a | 0; // int\n      b = b | 0; // int\n      var c = a & 0xffff;\n      var d = b & 0xffff;\n      // Shift by 0 fixes the sign on the high part.\n      return (c * d) + ((((a >>> 16) * d + c * (b >>> 16)) << 16) >>> 0) | 0; // int\n    };\n\n  // v8 has an optimization for storing 31-bit signed numbers.\n  // Values which have either 00 or 11 as the high order bits qualify.\n  // This function drops the highest order bit in a signed number, maintaining\n  // the sign bit.\n  function smi(i32) {\n    return ((i32 >>> 1) & 0x40000000) | (i32 & 0xBFFFFFFF);\n  }\n\n  function hash(o) {\n    if (o === false || o === null || o === undefined) {\n      return 0;\n    }\n    if (typeof o.valueOf === 'function') {\n      o = o.valueOf();\n      if (o === false || o === null || o === undefined) {\n        return 0;\n      }\n    }\n    if (o === true) {\n      return 1;\n    }\n    var type = typeof o;\n    if (type === 'number') {\n      var h = o | 0;\n      if (h !== o) {\n        h ^= o * 0xFFFFFFFF;\n      }\n      while (o > 0xFFFFFFFF) {\n        o /= 0xFFFFFFFF;\n        h ^= o;\n      }\n      return smi(h);\n    }\n    if (type === 'string') {\n      return o.length > STRING_HASH_CACHE_MIN_STRLEN ? cachedHashString(o) : hashString(o);\n    }\n    if (typeof o.hashCode === 'function') {\n      return o.hashCode();\n    }\n    return hashJSObj(o);\n  }\n\n  function cachedHashString(string) {\n    var hash = stringHashCache[string];\n    if (hash === undefined) {\n      hash = hashString(string);\n      if (STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE === STRING_HASH_CACHE_MAX_SIZE) {\n        STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE = 0;\n        stringHashCache = {};\n      }\n      STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE++;\n      stringHashCache[string] = hash;\n    }\n    return hash;\n  }\n\n  // http://jsperf.com/hashing-strings\n  function hashString(string) {\n    // This is the hash from JVM\n    // The hash code for a string is computed as\n    // s[0] * 31 ^ (n - 1) + s[1] * 31 ^ (n - 2) + ... + s[n - 1],\n    // where s[i] is the ith character of the string and n is the length of\n    // the string.

Rolls against Endurance determine things like whether your character can hang on to that rope over a canyon, or can resist the deadly cloud of bacteria some renegade scientist just sprayed in his or her face.\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"energyWeapons\": \"Energy Weapons\",\n\t\t\t\"experience\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"XP\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Experience\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"experienceMultiplier\": \"Experience Multiplier\",\n\t\t\t\"explorer\": \"Explorer\",\n\t\t\t\"explosiveDamage\": \"Explosive Damage\",\n\t\t\t\"explosives\": \"Explosives\",\n\t\t\t\"eyes\": \"Eyes\",\n\t\t\t\"fallDamage\": \"Fall Damage\",\n\t\t\t\"fastMetabolism\": \"Fast Metabolism\",\n\t\t\t\"fastShot\": \"Fast Shot\",\n\t\t\t\"fasterHealing\": \"Faster Healing\",\n\t\t\t\"fearTheReaper\": \"Fear The Reaper\",\n\t\t\t\"feralDog\": \"Feral Dog\",\n\t\t\t\"feralGhoul\": \"Feral Ghoul\",\n\t\t\t\"feralGhoulReaver\": \"Feral Ghoul Reaver\",\n\t\t\t\"feralGhoulRoamer\": \"Feral Ghoul Roamer\",\n\t\t\t\"feralGlowingOne\": \"Feral Glowing One\",\n\t\t\t\"finesse\": \"Finesse\",\n\t\t\t\"fireAnt\": \"Fire Ant\",\n\t\t\t\"fireBreath\": \"Fire Breath\",\n\t\t\t\"fireGecko\": \"Fire Gecko\",\n\t\t\t\"firstAid\": \"First Aid\",\n\t\t\t\"firstAidActionPointCost\": \"First Aid Action Point Cost\",\n\t\t\t\"firstAidHealing\": \"First Aid Healing\",\n\t\t\t\"flail\": \"Flail\",\n\t\t\t\"flailer\": \"Flailer\",\n\t\t\t\"flexible\": \"Flexible\",\n\t\t\t\"floater\": \"Floater\",\n\t\t\t\"flowerChild\": \"Flower Child\",\n\t\t\t\"forehead\": \"Forehead\",\n\t\t\t\"fortuneFinder\": \"Fortune Finder\",\n\t\t\t\"freeMovement\": \"Free Movement\",\n\t\t\t\"gainAgility\": \"Gain Agility\",\n\t\t\t\"gainCharisma\": \"Gain Charisma\",\n\t\t\t\"gainEndurance\": \"Gain Endurance\",\n\t\t\t\"gainIntelligence\": \"Gain Intelligence\",\n\t\t\t\"gainLuck\": \"Gain Luck\",\n\t\t\t\"gainPerception\": \"Gain Perception\",\n\t\t\t\"gainStrength\": \"Gain Strength\",\n\t\t\t\"gambler\": \"Gambler\",\n\t\t\t\"gambling\": \"Gambling\",\n\t\t\t\"gecko\": \"Gecko\",\n\t\t\t\"ghost\": \"Ghost\",\n\t\t\t\"ghoul\": \"Ghoul\",\n\t\t\t\"giantAnt\": \"Giant Ant\",\n\t\t\t\"giantRat\": \"Giant Rat\",\n\t\t\t\"gifted\": \"Gifted\",\n\t\t\t\"glowingOne\": \"Glowing One\",\n\t\t\t\"goldenGecko\": \"Golden Gecko\",\n\t\t\t\"goodNatured\": \"Good Natured\",\n\t\t\t\"greaterMolerat\": \"Greater Molerat\",\n\t\t\t\"greaterRadscorpion\": \"Greater Radscorption\",\n\t\t\t\"groin\": \"Groin\",\n\t\t\t\"gunner\": \"Gunner\",\n\t\t\t\"gut\": \"Gut\",\n\t\t\t\"hair\": \"Hair\",\n\t\t\t\"hamFisted\": \"Ham-Fisted\",\n\t\t\t\"hand\": \"Hand\",\n\t\t\t\"handToHandEvade\": \"Hand-to-Hand Evade\",\n\t\t\t\"harmless\": \"Harmless\",\n\t\t\t\"head\": \"Head\",\n\t\t\t\"healer\": \"Healer\",\n\t\t\t\"healingRate\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"HR\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Healing Rate\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"health\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"HP\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Health\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"heaveHo\": \"Heave, Ho!\",\n\t\t\t\"height\": \"Height\",\n\t\t\t\"hereAndNow\": \"Here and Now\",\n\t\t\t\"hideOfScars\": \"Hide of Scars\",\n\t\t\t\"hip\": \"Hip\",\n\t\t\t\"hitTheDeck\": \"Hit the Deck\",\n\t\t\t\"horn\": \"Horn\",\n\t\t\t\"human\": \"Human\",\n\t\t\t\"input\": \"input\",\n\t\t\t\"intelligence\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"Int\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Intelligence\",\n\t\t\t\t\"description\": \"Intelligence is a character's higher reasoning power.

Perceptive characters tend to be able to read another person's reactions, and can even tell when another person is lying. They can also make long-distance shots in combat that no one else can make. Highly perceptive characters are private investigators or snipers. Characters with low Perception walk about in their own little world. This statistic is used in the Sequence secondary statistic, and in several skills such as Lockpick, Traps, First Aid, and Doctor. The primary use of this statistic is to determine the maximum distance your character can shoot a ranged weapon effectively. The better the score, the farther you can accurately shoot. A high Perception is imperative for a sniper. Rolls against Perception are used when there is a little detail the character has a chance of noticing, such as the glisten off the scope of the sniper taking an aim at his or her head.\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"perks\": \"Perks\",\n\t\t\t\"pickpocket\": \"Pickpocket\",\n\t\t\t\"pilot\": \"Pilot\",\n\t\t\t\"presence\": \"Presence\",\n\t\t\t\"primaryTotal\": \"Primary Total\",\n\t\t\t\"psychoAddictionChance\": \"Psycho Addiction Chance\",\n\t\t\t\"psychoEffects\": \"Psycho Effects\",\n\t\t\t\"psychotic\": \"Psychotic\",\n\t\t\t\"pyromaniac\": \"Pyromaniac\",\n\t\t\t\"quickPockets\": \"Quick Pockets\",\n\t\t\t\"quickRecovery\": \"Quick Recovery\",\n\t\t\t\"race\": \"Race\",\n\t\t\t\"radChild\": \"Rad Child\",\n\t\t\t\"radRat\": \"Rad Rat\",\n\t\t\t\"radResistance\": \"Rad Resistance\",\n\t\t\t\"radiationBurst\": \"Radiation Burst\",\n\t\t\t\"radroach\": \"Radroach\",\n\t\t\t\"radsPerHour\": \"Rads per Hour\",\n\t\t\t\"ram\": \"Ram\",\n\t\t\t\"rangedActionPointCost\": \"Ranged Action Point Cost\",\n\t\t\t\"rangedDamage\": \"Ranged Damage\",\n\t\t\t\"rangedWeapons\": \"Ranged Weapons\",\n\t\t\t\"ranger\": \"Ranger\",\n\t\t\t\"receivedExplosiveDamage\": \"Received Explosion Damage\",\n\t\t\t\"redBaron\": \"Red Baron\",\n\t\t\t\"repair\": \"Repair\",\n\t\t\t\"repairHealing\": \"Repair Healing\",\n\t\t\t\"resistContactGas\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"CGR\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Contact Gas Resistance\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"resistElectricity\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"ER\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Electricity Resistance\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"resistExplosion\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"ExR\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Explosion Resistance\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"resistExplosionThreshold\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"ExT\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Explosion Threshold\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"resistFire\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"FR\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Fire Resistance\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"resistFireThreshold\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"FT\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Fire Threshold\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"resistInhaledGas\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"IGR\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Inhaled Gas Resistance\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"resistLaser\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"LR\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Laser Resistance\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"resistLaserThreshold\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"LT\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Laser Threshold\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"resistNormal\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"NR\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Normal Resistance\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"resistNormalThreshold\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"NT\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Normal Threshold\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"resistPlasma\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"PlR\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Plasma Resistance\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"resistPlasmaThreshold\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"PlT\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Plasma Threshold\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"resistPoison\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"PR\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Poison Resistance\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"resistRadiation\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"RR\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Radiation Resistance\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"rightArm\": \"Right Arm\",\n\t\t\t\"rightLeg\": \"Right Leg\",\n\t\t\t\"roadWarrior\": \"Road Warrior\",\n\t\t\t\"salesman\": \"Salesman\",\n\t\t\t\"science\": \"Science\",\n\t\t\t\"scout\": \"Scout\",\n\t\t\t\"screech\": \"Screech\",\n\t\t\t\"scrounger\": \"Scrounger\",\n\t\t\t\"sequence\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"Seq\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Sequence\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"sex\": \"Sex\",\n\t\t\t\"sexAppeal\": \"Sex Appeal\",\n\t\t\t\"sharpshooter\": \"Sharpshooter\",\n\t\t\t\"shoulder\": \"Shoulder\",\n\t\t\t\"silentDeath\": \"Silent Death\",\n\t\t\t\"silentRunning\": \"Silent Running\",\n\t\t\t\"simpleWeapons\": \"Simple Weapons\",\n\t\t\t\"skillPoints\": \"Skill Points\",\n\t\t\t\"skillPointsPerBook\": \"Skill Points per Book\",\n\t\t\t\"skillPointsPerLevel\": \"Skill Points per Level\",\n\t\t\t\"skilled\": \"Skilled\",\n\t\t\t\"skills\": \"Skills\",\n\t\t\t\"slayer\": \"Slayer\",\n\t\t\t\"smallFrame\": \"Small Frame\",\n\t\t\t\"smallGuns\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"SG\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Small Guns\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"smoothTalker\": \"Smooth Talker\",\n\t\t\t\"snakeEater\": \"Snake-Eater\",\n\t\t\t\"sneak\": \"Sneak\",\n\t\t\t\"sniper\": \"Sniper\",\n\t\t\t\"social\": \"Social\",\n\t\t\t\"speaker\": \"Speaker\",\n\t\t\t\"speech\": \"Speech\",\n\t\t\t\"spit\": \"Spit\",\n\t\t\t\"stalk\": \"Stalk\",\n\t\t\t\"standUpActionPointCost\": \"Stand Up Action Point Cost\",\n\t\t\t\"stat\": \"Stat!\",\n\t\t\t\"steadyArm\": \"Steady Arm\",\n\t\t\t\"steal\": \"Steal\",\n\t\t\t\"stoneWall\": \"Stonewall\",\n\t\t\t\"strength\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"abbr\": \"Str\",\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Strength\",\n\t\t\t\t\"description\": \"A measure of your character's physical strength and muscle power.
